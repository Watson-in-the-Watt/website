The Watson in the Watt (WitW) program enables AI education and research applications within the broader Clemson Community with a focus on Watson and other IBM Cloud services. Since its beginning in late 2017, this program has worked intensively with 58 students covering 20 academic majors to support research projects with faculty from 22 academic departments. This work has led to multiple presentations at academic conferences, publication of peer-reviewed research, generation of novel datasets, follow-on grant funding opportunities, and one patent application.

## Education
The Watson in the Watt Creative Inquiry course is the core educational activity of the WitW program. This credited course focuses on applied AI methodology in the context of academic research. The course has two educational tracks with each track having 1 classroom contact hour per week:

  1. First-time students: students taking the course for the first time work through an interdisciplinary program  covering a broad range of topics relevant to Artificial Intelligence including IBM Watson, cloud computing, machine learning, statistical reasoning, application development, and societal considerations of AI. Material is presented as a mixture of lecture content, classroom discussions, and homework assignments. The goal of this introductory course is to equip students with the skills they need to succeed in applied AI research at Clemson and beyond.
  2. Returning students: students taking the course for the 2nd or higher time participate in an “Advanced Topics” seminar course. Throughout the semester, all students present on topics of their choosing from the world of Artificial Intelligence. Presentations are followed by discussions facilitated by the WitW staff. The goal of this track is to broaden students’ exposures to diverse topics in AI and to deepen their mastery of specific topics that they present on. The returning student track is also designed to be “light weight” compared to the first-time student track leaving the returning students more time to focus on their research projects.
    
All students irrespective of track are placed on research projects as outlined in more detail below. In the context of these projects, the students receive more intensive, hands-on experience in specific areas as required by their projects.

## Leadership

### Executive Leadership
Dr. Todd Marek, Watt Center Executive Director, Dr. Kuang-Ching Wang, Watt Center Associate Director for Research, Dr. Barbara Speziale, Watt Center Associate Director for Academic Affairs and Director of Creative Inquiry, and Dr. Mark Krystofik, Watt Center Associate Director for Operations and Sustainability, have been integral to the vision, creation, and strategic leadership for the Watson in the Watt program.  The Executive Leadership team has been engaged in development of the Watson in the Watt project portfolio and integration of Watson in the Watt to broader initiatives across the university.

Dr. Hudson Smith joined the Watson in the Watt program in March 2018. Received his Bachelor’s degrees in Physics and Mathematics from Erskine College in Due West, SC and a Ph.D. in Physics from The Ohio State University where he studied theoretical quantum mechanics with an emphasis on scientific computing. Following his graduate work, Hudson entered the data science industry, applying statistics and machine learning techniques to solve problems within the healthcare domain. Hudson’s primary research interests are in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Representation Learning through his work in the WitW program has him involved in everything ML and AI!

Dr. Carl Ehrett is a research associate in the Watson in the Watt program in the Watt Family Innovation Center. He facilitates research activities applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, and works with students and faculty to foster interdisciplinary collaboration growing the AI and analytics community within Clemson. Carl received an M.A. in philosophy from the University of Kentucky with emphasis on cognitive science. He then earned a Ph.D. in analytic philosophy from Northwestern University, researching semantic modeling of vagueness in natural language. Carl went on to earn an M.S. from Clemson's School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, focusing on computational mathematics and statistics, and is currently a Ph.D. candidate studying Bayesian statistics and computer model calibration.
