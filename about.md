The Watson in the Watt (WitW) program enables AI education and research applications within the broader Clemson Community with a focus on Watson and other IBM Cloud services. Since its beginning in late 2017, this program has worked intensively with 58 students covering 20 academic majors to support research projects with faculty from 22 academic departments. This work has led to multiple presentations at academic conferences, publication of peer-reviewed research, generation of novel datasets, follow-on grant funding opportunities, and one patent application.

Dr. Hudson Smith joined the Watson in the Watt program in March 2018. Received his Bachelor’s degrees in Physics and Mathematics from Erskine College in Due West, SC and a Ph.D. in Physics from The Ohio State University where he studied theoretical quantum mechanics with an emphasis on scientific computing. Following his graduate work, Hudson entered the data science industry, applying statistics and machine learning techniques to solve problems within the healthcare domain. Hudson’s primary research interests are in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Representation Learning through his work in the WitW program has him involved in everything ML and AI!

Dr. Carl Ehrett is a research associate in the Watson in the Watt program in the Watt Family Innovation Center. He facilitates research activities applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, and works with students and faculty to foster interdisciplinary collaboration growing the AI and analytics community within Clemson. Carl received an M.A. in philosophy from the University of Kentucky with emphasis on cognitive science. He then earned a Ph.D. in analytic philosophy from Northwestern University, researching semantic modeling of vagueness in natural language. Carl went on to earn an M.S. from Clemson's School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, focusing on computational mathematics and statistics, and is currently a Ph.D. candidate studying Bayesian statistics and computer model calibration.
